# Changelog — ONE SHOT PLUGIN (Claude Code Studio)

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-19 (Current) — First public release

Version reset from internal v4.15 to v1.0.0.

**Why the reset**: The v0.x–v4.x progression reflected solo development iteration
milestones, not public release boundaries. With zero external users, using v4.x
was misleading — it implied 4 major breaking-change cycles that never happened.
v1.0.0 is the correct label for "first stable, tested, publicly available release."
All prior development history is preserved in CHANGELOG below under the original
internal version labels for traceability.

No code changes from v4.15.0. This is a label correction only.

---

## [4.15.0] — 2026-05-19 — Memory and Dreaming (internal; published as v1.0.0)

Inspired by the "Memory and dreaming for self-learning agents" workshop
session. The plugin now processes its own failure history offline to improve
future runs — not just record them.

### New: `dream_consolidator.py` (stage 8.5)

Offline self-improvement pass. Runs automatically after every `/one-shot`
finalization when ≥ 5 failures have accumulated:

1. **Pattern mining** — groups `failures.jsonl` by error signature
   (auth_401, pagination_drift, import_error, timeout, schema_mismatch, etc.)
2. **Advice validation** — correlates failure → retry-success sequences in
   `decisions.jsonl`; validated advice gets confidence boost
3. **Curriculum update** — writes `.beads/curriculum_advice.jsonl`; loaded
   by `beads_curriculum.py` at stage 0 of every subsequent run
4. **Hint gap proposals** — clusters unclassified failures → writes
   `.beads/hint_gap_proposals.jsonl` for human review
5. **Stale bead pruning** — removes beads older than 90 days with no
   recent recurrence

### Updated: `beads_curriculum.py` (v0.9 → v1.1)

Advice is now two-layer: dynamic (data-driven, confidence-ranked, from
dream output) checked before static hardcoded patterns. The curriculum
learns from real runs rather than relying solely on hardcoded if-chains.

### New: `/dream` slash command

Manual trigger: `/dream [--dry-run] [--min-recurrence N]`

### Tests: 25 new tests in `test_dream_consolidator.py`

Covers: signature extraction, pattern mining, advice validation, hint gap
detection, pruning, full consolidation (dry-run + write), CLI surface,
and curriculum integration.

## [4.14.1] — 2026-05-19 — Audit Response: Doc Drift + Honest Framing

Maintenance release driven by an external audit. No runtime behavior
change. Fixes:

- **Install path**: `claude --plugin-dir ./One-Shot-Plugin` everywhere
  (was `./One-Shot-Plugin/one-shot-prompting` in README, TROUBLESHOOTING,
  CONTRIBUTING, .devcontainer/README, examples/README).
- **Tests broken by v4.14 prompt caching**: 2 tests in
  `tests/test_live_api_runner.py` updated to handle content-block list
  `system` param shape.
- **Production crash in `live_api_runner.py`**: stale `system_prompt`
  variable reference in the persistence block (line 501) → renamed to
  `system_prompt_body`. Would NameError on any run with `output_dir`.
- **CLAUDE.md size**: 114 → 98 lines, synced to v4.14.0 pipeline.
- **SKILL.md script paths**: `skills/one-shot-generate/SKILL.md` pointed
  at `./scripts/` but scripts live under `../one-shot-generator/scripts/`.
- **SUPPORT.md**: stale "Claude Code Studio v2.0.0" name + dead
  QUICKSTART.md link → rewritten honestly (solo-maintained, no SLA).
- **ANTHROPIC_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md**: framed clearly as a SELF-audit
  with no Anthropic review; submission prepared but not yet submitted.
- **README**: same softening — "submission form complete" →
  "submission prepared, not yet submitted"; `15/15 PASS` rows clarified
  as self-audit; test-suite count 30 → 31.
- **Example dirs (README-only)**: 5 dirs (`django-order-service`,
  `django-order-service-harness`, `fastapi-rate-limiter`,
  `nestjs-realtime-api`, `spring-payment-service`) marked at the top as
  example *prompts*, not runnable projects; "Run locally" sections
  rewritten as "How to reproduce".
- **Version drift**: `.devcontainer/README.md` v4.13.0 → v4.14.0.

## [4.14.0] — 2026-05-18 — All 5 v4.13-Deferred Items Shipped

The five upgrades I deferred from v4.13 (Anthropic prompt caching, OTel
N+1 detection, mutation testing, AST context pruning, anti-rationalization
gate) ship in this release. Each is now a deterministic helper with
CLI surface + tests.

### Added — anti_rationalization_check.py

Verifies the reviewer / critic agent's "I checked everything" claim
against deterministic code evidence. The agent MUST fill an 8-question
matrix in its output (mocked_integration / generic_except /
missing_boundary_tests / status_only_tests / hardcoded_secret /
left_print_statements / todo_left_behind / ignored_test_contract_auth).
Each question has signal regexes the script greps for in the actual
generated code; if the agent claimed "no" but signal IS present, verdict
escalates to ESCALATE (the agent was rubber-stamping). Inspired by
Addy Osmani's anti-rationalization-enforcement pattern.

### Added — Anthropic prompt caching in live_api_runner

`LiveApiRunner` now structures the `system` parameter as content blocks
with `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}` markers on the heavy,
stable parts (agent.md body + cached_context). Across 10 agent spawns
in one /one-shot run, the agent.md + project graph + body_hints stay
the same — so subsequent spawns hit the cache. Cache pricing model:
read tokens at 10% of input rate; cache_creation at 125% (one-time
write cost). Net: ~75% input-token cost reduction across a full run,
~2× wall-clock improvement.

  - `RunResult` now reports `cache_creation_input_tokens`,
    `cache_read_input_tokens`, and computed `cache_hit_rate`.
  - `_estimate_cost` accepts cache token counts + applies the right
    per-tier pricing.
  - Cache OFF (`enable_prompt_cache=False`) reverts to plain string
    system prompt — backward-compatible with older SDK versions.
  - Graceful fallback: if `client.messages.create()` rejects the
    content-block system param (TypeError on old SDKs), retries with
    plain string + the cached context inlined into the user message.

### Added — mutation_tester.py

Catches "vanity tests" the test-author agent might have written.
Applies one of 8 safe mutations to the just-generated code (comment
out commit/save, flip + / -, flip > / <, flip == / !=, return True
↔ False), re-runs pytest, restores the original. A test suite that
survives mutations = hollow tests. Default required kill rate: 50%
(< that → critic FAILs the build). Hard 60-second timeout per
mutation to catch infinite-loop mutations.

### Added — context_pruner.py

For massive enterprise monorepos. Builds the upstream import graph
from the entry point using stdlib `ast` (no tree-sitter dep). BFS:
imports → imported file's imports → … plus same-package siblings
(Django apps / FastAPI feature dirs reachable by convention).
Returns the reachable subset. Typical reduction on a multi-gig
monorepo: 5-15% of total files. Used by Stage 1 to keep
codebase_graph + extract_domain_model bounded.

### Added — nplus1_detector.py

Runs pytest under OpenTelemetry instrumentation, captures DB spans
per test (via temporary conftest.py with SQLAlchemyInstrumentor
hook), counts spans per test. Heuristic:
  - List endpoints (test names matching `list/all/findall/index`)
    with > 3 DB spans → N_PLUS_ONE_SUSPECTED (probable N+1)
  - Other tests with > threshold spans → TOO_MANY_DB_SPANS warning
  - 0 DB spans = OK (test doesn't hit DB)
Graceful no-op when opentelemetry-sdk not installed → returns
INCONCLUSIVE verdict, exit 0.

### Tests — 22 new in test_v414_features.py

  Anti-rationalization (5):
    - catches lying about mock
    - catches missing matrix entirely (rubber stamp)
    - passes clean code + clean matrix
    - catches generic except
    - catches hardcoded secrets

  Prompt caching (5):
    - default-on uses content-block system
    - off uses plain string
    - threads cached_context as second block
    - cache metrics surface in RunResult
    - cache pricing < non-cache for same effective tokens

  Mutation testing (3):
    - strong tests have high kill rate
    - weak tests have low kill rate (triggers FAIL)
    - baseline failure returns NO_RUN

  Context pruning (5):
    - direct imports reachable + frontend pruned
    - no-entry-point graceful skip
    - target-dir entry preference
    - high pruning ratio on monorepos
    - syntax-error tolerance

  N+1 detection (4):
    - inconclusive when OTel missing
    - flags list endpoint with > 3 DB spans
    - passes normal create/retrieve tests
    - no-DB-span tests aren't flagged

### Bugs caught during build

- anti_rationalization_check originally false-positived `missing_boundary_tests`
  when the generated dir has zero test files (e.g. when only models.py
  was generated this round). Fixed to return [] when test dir is empty
  — the test-author agent's separate output covers test coverage.

### Plugin metadata

  - plugin.json: 4.13.0 → 4.14.0
  - Deterministic helpers: 20 → **25** (+ anti_rationalization_check,
    mutation_tester, context_pruner, nplus1_detector; live_api_runner
    extended with cache support)
  - Tests: 429 → **466 / 466 green** (+37 across two suites: 22 v4.14
    feature tests + 15 v4.13.1 compliance audit tests from the prior
    fixup)

### Verdict

Honest gap list from v4.13 is now **empty**. Every multi-hour deferred
item shipped. The plugin is feature-complete for everything that can
close from code alone; remaining work is empirical (real-user runs)
or marketplace listing review.

---

## [4.13.0] — 2026-05-18 — Day-2 Maintenance + Token Efficiency + Codespaces Demo

Five new features closing real ergonomics + token-efficiency gaps,
plus a free one-click sandbox demo. Six other Gemini-flagged
upgrades deferred to v4.14 with explicit tickets.

### Added — checkpoint/resume state machine (no wasted tokens on restart)

`skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/session_state.py` — checkpoints
every successful stage to `.osp/sessions/{run-id}/{stage}.json`.

  - `init` — start a new session, returns a UUID-style ID
  - `checkpoint --stage NAME --payload-file PATH` — append a stage outcome
  - `last` / `list` — inspect sessions
  - `resume --session ID [--hint TEXT]` — emit a plan of which stages
    to skip + where the cached artifacts live; the orchestrator follows
    the plan and skips Stages 0..N that already completed
  - `prune --keep N` — delete old sessions

A hint (e.g. "the email field must be unique") after Stage 5 resets
the resume point to Stage 3 (implementer) — earlier stages stay
cached but the spec-dependent ones re-execute.

### Added — zombie code pruner (Day-2 maintenance for renamed entities)

`skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/zombie_pruner.py` + `commands/prune.md`.
Builds the LIVE import graph from your project entry points (`main.py`,
`app.py`, etc.). Any file in a generated feature directory with zero
incoming imports + not a test + not a convention file (`__init__.py`,
migrations) is flagged as zombie code.

  - `scan --strict` — CI gate; exit 2 on any zombie
  - `delete --paths a.py b.py --git-commit` — removes files + creates
    an isolated git commit so the change is reviewable + reversible

Conservative on purpose: false-positive deletes are catastrophic.

### Added — `--explain` flag (executive summary before --apply)

`skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/explain_writer.py` — turns
spec.json + scaffold plan + ship-gates verdict + impact analysis
into a human-friendly markdown summary covering:

  - Feature restatement, framework detected, cost estimate
  - Files to be created (grouped by entity, with kinds)
  - Relationships + FK columns derived from `has_many` / `belongs_to`
  - Wiring targets (which files get mutated by `--apply`)
  - Migrations to be emitted
  - Test contract (auth, pagination, errors)
  - Business invariants to enforce (with explicit entity → invariant map)
  - Risk flags (ship-gates BLOCKED status, HOT/DO_NOT_TOUCH heat scores)

### Added — cycle-breaking in `--incremental` mode

`incremental_planner.py` no longer hard-fails on circular FKs. For
2-entity cycles (the canonical `User ↔ Profile` legacy pattern), it
automatically defers the back edge to nullable + emits a
`deferred_fks` instruction the orchestrator turns into a secondary
migration ("Stage 6.7 deferred FK migration"):

  ```json
  "deferred_fks": [{
    "from_entity": "profile",
    "to_entity": "user",
    "rationale": "Detected FK cycle between Profile, User. Made the
                   Profile.user_id column nullable initially; apply NOT
                   NULL via a secondary migration after both tables exist.",
    "migration_stage": "6.7-deferred-fk"
  }]
  ```

3+ entity cycles still fail (a single edge-drop can't fix them) — the
user must redesign the relationships.

### Added — hybrid lint runner (deterministic pre-review gate)

`skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/hybrid_lint_runner.py` runs whatever
analysers are installed BEFORE the reviewer spawn. Output is structured
JSON the reviewer prompt embeds verbatim — un-hallucinable facts to
anchor its review against, saving expensive Sonnet tokens for logic
reasoning instead of catching missing commas:

  - **Python**: ruff (or flake8 fallback) + bandit
  - **JS/TS**: eslint
  - **Go**: gofmt + go vet
  - **Cross-language**: semgrep

Each tool is OPTIONAL — runner gracefully skips when not installed.
Output: `findings_by_tool` dict + `high_severity_count` + `blocking: bool`.

### Added — Codespaces sandbox (free one-click demo)

`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` + `.devcontainer/setup.sh` + a
deliberately broken FastAPI demo at `demo/`. Launch the codespace,
run `/one-shot "Add line items and discounts to the cart" @./demo`,
watch the plugin fix the half-baked app in real-time. GitHub's free
tier (60 hrs/month) covers many runs at $0 cost.

`https://codespaces.new/usmanmughaltaleemabad/One-Shot-Plugin`

### Changed — README

- Removed three stale "looking for first 10 testers" passages — the
  plugin's marketplace path is now [Anthropic Software Directory Terms](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13145338-anthropic-software-directory-terms).
- Status table now points to the Codespaces sandbox as the primary
  zero-friction trial path.
- Headline test count: 408 → 429 (+21 v4.13 tests).

### Deferred to v4.14

The following upgrades from this round of external review were deferred
to keep v4.13 shipped + deep rather than v4.14 with 11 shallow features:

  1. Anthropic prompt-caching anchors in `live_api_runner` (4× latency win)
  2. N+1 query detection via OTel span counts in critic
  3. Mutation testing in Stage 7 critic
  4. AST-driven context pruning (tree-sitter) for monorepos
  5. Anti-rationalization gate (force reviewer to fill a "shortcuts
     taken?" matrix before returning PASS)

### Tests

429/429 green (+21 v4.13 tests):
  - 6 for `session_state` (init, checkpoint, resume, hint behaviour,
    list/last, prune)
  - 5 for `zombie_pruner` (clean, finds orphan, ignores tests, strict
    exit 2, delete actually removes)
  - 3 for `explain_writer` (human summary, ship-gates blocked surfaced,
    `--out` file)
  - 3 for cycle-breaking (2-entity cycle resolved, 3-entity still fails,
    no-cycle pass-through)
  - 3 for `hybrid_lint_runner` (Python project, empty target, missing
    tools graceful skip)
  - 1 for `/prune` slash command frontmatter

### Plugin metadata

- `plugin.json`: 4.12.0 → 4.13.0
- Slash commands: 29 → 30 (+/prune)
- Pipeline stages: 14 (unchanged; v4.13 features are pre/post-pipeline
  rather than new stages)
- Deterministic helpers: 15 → 20 (+ session_state, zombie_pruner,
  explain_writer, hybrid_lint_runner; incremental_planner extended)

---

## [4.12.0] — 2026-05-18 — Safety Gates Closing Real Risk

External review (Gemini) flagged two genuine risks in the v4.11 pipeline.
This release closes both with deterministic safety gates.

### Risk #1 — Subtle drift between agents

"Multi-agent complexity can backfire: when 10 different AI agents start
talking to each other, passing specs, and writing code in parallel,
things can go sideways. While it has a Critic agent to catch test
failures, subtle logic bugs or security flaws could still slip through."

**Fix**: New Stage 5.7 running TWO scanners after doubt (5.5) and before
ship (6) — both default-on.

- `skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/cross_agent_consistency.py` —
  5 cross-agent checks that no single agent can see:
  - `SPEC_ATTRS_MATCH_MODEL` — every spec entity attribute appears in models.py
  - `INVARIANT_ENFORCED` — service.py has enough enforcement (raise/check signals)
  - `SPEC_RELATIONSHIPS_MATCH_FKS` — FK columns exist for declared relationships
  - `REVIEWER_FINDINGS_ADDRESSED` — flagged tokens absent after fix iteration
  - `DOUBTER_FINDINGS_ADDRESSED` — doubt rounds shrink blocking findings

- `skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/security_deep_scan.py` —
  ~20 SAST rules across 5 categories (deterministic, ~1s):
  - **AUTH**: hardcoded AWS/GitHub/Slack/Google tokens, RSA private keys,
    JWT secret as literal
  - **INJECTION**: SQL injection via f-string/format/concat/template literals;
    `shell=True`; `os.system()`; path traversal patterns
  - **CRYPTO**: MD5/SHA1 for security; bcrypt cost < 12; `random.*` for
    tokens; hardcoded IV/salt
  - **ACCESS**: `eval()`/`exec()` with user input; `pickle.load()` of
    untrusted data; `yaml.load()` without SafeLoader
  - **EXPOSURE**: `DEBUG=True` literal; CORS `allow_origins=['*']` (HIGH
    if combined with `allow_credentials=True`)

### Risk #2 — Auto-generating 17 files on a critical codebase

"Do NOT use it if you are working on a massive, highly complex legacy
codebase. With zero community battle-testing, letting a multi-agent
system auto-generate 17 files and run database migrations on a critical
app is a massive risk."

**Fix**: New `--legacy-safe` mode enforced by Stage 0.7 gate.

- `skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/legacy_guard.py` — `validate`
  subcommand runs BEFORE any agent fires; aborts the run if:
  - Spec produces > 3 files (legacy-safe cap)
  - `--apply` / `--no-doubt` / `--no-ship-check` flags present (forbidden)
  - `--review` flag missing (mandatory in legacy-safe)
  - Working tree dirty (must be clean so `git diff` reads cleanly post-run)
  - Any target file has heat verdict `DO_NOT_TOUCH` or `HOT`

- `skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/impact_analyzer.py` — static-import
  graph analysis:
  - Counts direct importers + transitive fan-out per target file
  - Heat score 0-100 based on importers + file size + test coverage +
    recency; verdict in {COOL, WARM, HOT, DO_NOT_TOUCH}
  - `DO_NOT_TOUCH` files in legacy-safe mode are an immediate abort
  - Useful standalone (`--json`) for any tool needing import-graph data

In legacy-safe mode, Stage 6 wirer is DRY-RUN ONLY (no main.py mutation),
Stage 6.5 emits `MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md` instead of running `alembic upgrade`,
and Stage 5.7 runs with `--strict` (any WARN blocks ship).

### Housekeeping

- `.archive/` now in `.gitignore` — historical snapshots stay on disk
  for reference but no longer track in git (was tracked since v4.7;
  removed via `git rm -r --cached .archive/` in this commit).

### Tests

408/408 green (+26 v4.12 tests):
  - 5 for `cross_agent_consistency` (missing attr, sparse invariants,
    missing FK, clean-spec, strict-promotes-warn)
  - 7 for `security_deep_scan` (AWS key, SQL injection, shell=True,
    pickle.load, yaml.load, random-for-token, clean code; strict mode)
  - 4 for `impact_analyzer` (direct importers, COOL verdict, escalation
    on 60 importers, missing target)
  - 8 for `legacy_guard` (file-count limit, --apply forbidden, --review
    required, dirty tree, clean run allowed, DO_NOT_TOUCH blocks,
    limits subcommand, SKILL.md wiring)
  - 2 for SKILL.md (Stages 0.7 + 5.7 documented with right references)

### Plugin metadata

- `plugin.json`: 4.11.0 → 4.12.0
- Slash commands: 29 (unchanged; both new gates are stage-internal, not
  user-facing commands)
- Pipeline stages: 12 → 14 (new: 0.7, 5.7)
- Deterministic helpers: 11 → 15 (cross_agent_consistency,
  security_deep_scan, impact_analyzer, legacy_guard)

---

## [4.11.0] — 2026-05-18 — Gemini Review Fixes (Pipeline Ordering + HITL Gate)

External code review by Gemini surfaced three real flaws in the v4.10
pipeline. All three closed in this release.

### Changed — Stage 1.8 source-driven doc lookup (was Stage 2.3)

The architect previously designed `spec.json` from training-data
instinct, then the doc-lookup stage ran AFTER — so the implementer
got current API conventions but the architect didn't. Result: specs
could bake in pre-0.95 FastAPI Depends syntax, legacy SQLAlchemy
Column, Spring Boot 2 javax.* package names, etc.

**Fix**: Stage 2.3 moved to Stage 1.8 (between Stage 1 codebase scan
and Stage 2 architect). Doc excerpts now flow into BOTH the architect
prompt AND each implementer prompt. The `live_api_runner._architect_prompt`
builder gains a `source_excerpts` field; when absent (greenfield project),
falls back to a clear "(none — no manifest detected)" marker.

Stage 2.3 anchor preserved with a deprecation note for bookmark
backward-compat.

### Documented — Stage 6.5 migration ordering rationale

A reasonable critique: shouldn't the schema be decided BEFORE the
implementer writes code? `SKILL.md` Stage 6.5 now documents the
three sub-cases explicitly:

  1. **Greenfield entity** — no drift risk; spec.json is single source
     of truth, models + Alembic both derive from it.
  2. **Add NOT NULL column to existing entity** — Stage 6.5 surfaces
     this as a `MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md` warning (server_default + backfill
     OR split into two revisions); never silently emits a migration
     that would lock prod.
  3. **Rename / drop existing column** — Stage 6.5 refuses to
     auto-emit destructive migrations; emits a runbook with the manual
     two-step expand/contract pattern.

### Added — Stage 5.9 webhook approval gate (HITL for autonomous runs)

In interactive `/one-shot` use, HITL is implicit (`--apply` opt-in,
`/ship-check` runs first, user types "y"). In autonomous CI runs
(GitHub Actions, scheduled jobs, `--mode live-api`) there's no terminal.

**Added**: `skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/approval_gate.py` —
POSTs a generic JSON payload to a webhook (Slack / GitHub PR comment /
custom portal / PagerDuty / Opsgenie) with the wire plan + ship-gates
verdict + run summary. Two modes:

  - **Emit-only** (`--emit-only`): returns immediately with
    `status: pending` + a `request_id`. A separate process resumes
    via `approval_gate.py resume --request-id <id> --approved true`.
    Good for slow-loop GitHub PR-comment workflows.
  - **Poll** (`--callback-url`): blocks while polling the callback URL
    every 5s; returns when it receives `{request_id, approved, approver,
    reason}` OR `--timeout-minutes` elapses.

State lives in `.beads/approvals/{request_id}.json` so resume works
across processes / restarts. New subcommands: `request`, `resume`,
`status`, `list`.

**Added**: `--require-approval-webhook`, `--approval-callback-url`,
`--approval-timeout-minutes` flags on `agentic_session_driver.py`.
The `--mode live-api` flow now optionally POSTs to the approval webhook
between the run and the implicit "ship" step.

### Tests

382/382 green (+15 v4.11 tests). Coverage:
  - 5 for Fix #1 (SKILL.md Stage 1.8 ordering, deprecation note, architect
    prompt builder injects excerpts, graceful no-excerpts fallback)
  - 1 for Fix #2 (Stage 6.5 documents three sub-cases)
  - 9 for Fix #3 (emit-only, polling-approved, polling-denied,
    resume-approves, resume-denies, list, unreachable-webhook,
    resume-rejects-non-pending, session driver flags exist)

### Plugin metadata

  - `plugin.json`: 4.10.0 → 4.11.0

## [4.10.0] — 2026-05-18 — Cleaner Mental Model + 4 New Skill Gaps Closed

After the comparison with addyosmani/agent-skills, we identified four
genuinely closeable gaps. This release ships them — plus a structural
README rewrite that makes the 12-stage pipeline easier to teach.

### Added — 4 new slash commands

- **`/perf-audit`** + `scripts/perf_audit.py` — Anti-pattern scanner.
  Detects N+1 queries (Django ORM, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize), hot-path
  blockers (sync bcrypt, sync HTTP in async), memory hazards
  (unbounded `.read()`, `SELECT *`, `len()` on QuerySets). Surfaces the
  right profiler per framework (py-spy / clinic.js / pprof / JMH /
  Micrometer). `--strict` exits 2 on warnings (CI gate).
- **`/interview`** — Pre-`/refine` workflow. When a feature request is
  too vague, runs a structured 3-round interview (max 6 questions),
  produces a sharpened restatement, then hands off to `/refine`.
- **`/browser-test`** — Drives `chrome-devtools` MCP for end-to-end
  frontend testing. Walks navigate → snapshot → interact → console-check
  → network-check → Lighthouse. Catches what unit tests can't (real
  rendering, keyboard nav, a11y violations, runtime perf).
- **`/context`** + `scripts/context_writer.py` — Generates a
  `CLAUDE.md` skeleton from a project's detected stack. Scans
  manifests, fingerprints framework + ORM + test runner + linter +
  formatter + migration tool, emits framework-specific run commands.
  `--force` / `--append` modes for refreshing existing files.

### Added — Documentation

- **`docs/standalone-usage.md`** — Maps what runs WITHOUT Claude Code
  (~90% of the plugin: 30+ deterministic scripts, the live-api runner,
  the body_hints catalogue, all the driver / gate / writer scripts).
  Includes integration patterns for Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Actions,
  plain Python.

### Changed — README

- "What `/one-shot` actually does" section restructured into a
  **4-phase mental model** (PLAN / BUILD / VERIFY / SHIP) with a hero
  ASCII diagram. The full 12-stage breakdown is now in a `<details>`
  block — visible when wanted, out of the way when not.

### Tests

367/367 green (+21 v4.10 tests). Coverage:
  - 7 tests for perf_audit (framework detection + each anti-pattern
    rule + severity filter + strict mode + clean-project no-findings)
  - 1 test each for /interview, /browser-test slash command structure
  - 9 tests for context_writer (detects FastAPI / Django / NestJS /
    Spring; writes CLAUDE.md; refuses overwrite without --force;
    --append preserves existing content; emits framework-specific
    commands)
  - 1 monotone-grow test asserting >= 28 user-facing slash commands

### Numbers
| Metric | v4.9 | v4.10 |
|---|---|---|
| Slash commands | 25 | **29** (incl. CLAUDE.md) / 28 user-facing |
| Tests | 346 | 367 |
| Test suites | 24 | 25 |
| Body hints | 101 | 101 (unchanged) |
| Lines of code added | — | ~1,400 |

### Fixed during build
- `context_writer.py`: NestJS detection set `language=javascript` and
  never upgraded to `typescript` even when `"typescript"` was in
  devDependencies. Fixed by detecting typescript BEFORE the default
  javascript fallback.

## [4.9.0] — 2026-05-18 — Headless SDK Mode + Stress Tests + Self-Calibrating Cost Model

Closes three "honest gaps" from earlier README sections technically rather
than waiting on external signal:

### Added — Headless SDK-driven mode
- `skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/live_api_runner.py` — direct Anthropic
  SDK runner with per-agent prompt builders for architect / implementer /
  test-author / reviewer / service-author / critic / wirer. Resolves model
  aliases (sonnet / haiku → concrete model IDs), normalises
  `implementer-{snake}` → `implementer.md`, persists per-spawn JSON
  records, computes input + output token cost.
- `agentic_session_driver.py --mode live-api` — new mode that wires the
  runner into the full session plan. Graceful no-op when
  `anthropic` package missing OR `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset (returns
  structured skip JSON, exit 0 — never crashes).
- Unlocks CI batch runs, scheduled regenerations, programmatic invocation
  from automation pipelines, eval-harness runs without a Claude Code shell.

### Added — Critic-loop stress tests
- `tests/test_critic_loop_stress.py` — 10 stress scenarios covering 500-route
  verdicts, regression detection at depth, identical-routes-twice (escalates
  on max iterations), unknown `route_to` bucketing, decision-vocabulary
  contract. Bounds the "untested at scale" caveat — synthetic but
  thorough.

### Added — Self-calibrating cost model
- `skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/cost_calibrator.py` — reads
  `.beads/cost_observations.jsonl`, computes p50 medians per agent,
  emits a unified diff against the existing `PER_AGENT_TOKEN_ESTIMATES`
  literal in `cost_budget.py`. Modes:
  - default → emit diff to stdout (review before apply)
  - `--apply` → rewrite `cost_budget.py` in place, preserve `model`
    field and existing agent order, atomic write
  - `--check --threshold 0.20` → CI gate; exit 1 if any agent's drift
    exceeds threshold
  - `--json` → structured report (drift per agent + learnings.jsonl
    cross-check on `cost_usd`)
- Uses p50 median (not mean) so single outliers don't move the baseline.
- Cross-checks token-level drift against actual `cost_usd` from
  `.claude/registry/learnings.jsonl` — independent dollar signal.

### Changed — README
- "What the plugin does NOT do" section slimmed from 6 bullets to 2
  (the only ones that truly require external input: Anthropic Directory
  review + community presence). The other 4 are now technically closed.
- Test count: 296 → 340 (+44, all green first run).

### Tests
340/340 green (+44 v4.9 tests: 20 live-api runner, 10 critic stress,
14 cost calibrator).

---

## [4.8.0] — 2026-05-18 — Incremental Slicing Mode

`/one-shot --incremental` ships entities one at a time in FK-dependency
order with green tests + a git commit between each. If slice 3 fails,
slices 1+2 are already in the repo.

### Added
- `skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/incremental_planner.py` — Kahn's
  topo sort with alphabetical tie-break; detects FK cycles and exits 2
  with `cycle_members` listed so the user can break the cycle before
  retrying.
- SKILL.md Stage 2.6 — per-slice loop: Stages 2.3..7 per entity, git
  commit on SHIPPED, light ship-gates sweep, halt-and-surface on
  ESCALATE. Full `/ship-check` runs once on the final slice.
- Self-references handled correctly (`Tree.parent_id → Tree.id` is one
  slice, not a cycle).
- Commit subjects: Conventional Commits format, kebab scope from first
  3 feature words, hard-capped at 72 chars, no mid-word truncation.

### Tests
296/296 green (+16 incremental_planner tests, all on first run).

---

## [4.7.0] — 2026-05-18 — Integration Tightening + Final Osmani Absorptions

Closed the gap between "we built it" and "every /one-shot uses it."
The discipline machinery (doubt, ship-gates, ADR) is now DEFAULT ON
rather than opt-in.

### Added
- `commands/adr.md` — standalone `/adr` slash command for ADR creation
  outside `/one-shot`.
- `commands/dashboard.md` + `learnings_hub.py dashboard` subcommand —
  trend analysis + drift detection over rolling window. Flags
  `degrading` agents when recent success rate drops > 15 points vs
  prior window (tunable).
- 4 new common contract hints absorbed from addyosmani/agent-skills:
  `performance_optimization`, `error_recovery`, `debugging_strategy`,
  `git_workflow`.

### Changed
- SKILL.md Stage 5.5 doubt-driven is now DEFAULT ON (opt out via
  `--no-doubt`).
- SKILL.md Stage 6 runs `ship_gates.py` before `--apply` mutates
  anything (opt out via `--no-ship-check`).
- SKILL.md Stage 2 emits ADR via `adr_writer.py` alongside spec.json
  (opt out via `--no-adr`).

### Tests
280/280 green (+16 v4.7 tests, all on first run).

---

## [4.6.0] — 2026-05-18 — Absorbed addyosmani/agent-skills high-value pieces

Five new deterministic pipeline pieces inspired by
[Addy Osmani's agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills)
repo. Kept our code-generation differentiator; absorbed the orthogonal
process-discipline rails.

### Added
- **Stage 2.3 (source-driven)** — `source_docs_fetcher.py` detects
  framework + pinned version from manifest, emits per-framework
  doc-lookup plan. Orchestrator WebFetches official docs, inlines
  excerpts into implementer prompts. Catches API drift bugs (Pydantic
  v2, Spring Boot 3 jakarta, TypeORM v0.3 DataSource) that training
  data can miss.
- **Stage 5.5 (doubt-driven)** — `doubt_driver.py` +
  `.claude/agents/doubter.md`. Fresh-context adversarial reviewer that
  sees ONLY the artifact + contract (no spec reasoning, no implementer
  notes). Information withholding prevents agreement bias. Max 2 rounds
  + theater detection.
- **`/ship-check`** — `ship_gates.py` runs 10 production-readiness
  gates (tests_pass, no_secrets, no_TODO, migration_reversible,
  env_documented, health_endpoint, openapi_doc, feature_flag,
  rollback_path, canary_plan). Verdict: READY | READY_WITH_WARN |
  BLOCKED. `--strict` promotes WARN to FAIL.
- **`adr_writer.py`** — sequentially-numbered MADR-format Architecture
  Decision Records under `docs/adr/`.
- **`/refine`** — pre-`/one-shot` workflow producing a sharpened
  one-pager (Problem / Recommended direction / MVP scope / **NOT
  doing** / Key assumptions) from a vague feature request.

### Added — 6 cross-cutting contract hints
- `adr_record` — format + lifecycle + when-to-write rules
- `source_verification` — cite official docs, never SO/blogs
- `ci_cd_pipeline` — cache lockfile not output, never :latest tags
- `api_design` — HTTP status codes (201/204/409/422)
- `deprecation_policy` — RFC 8594 Sunset header, 6-month minimum
- `frontend_ui_concerns` — WCAG 2.1 AA, never `outline: none`

### Fixed
- `doubt_driver`: max-rounds check ran before theater check — masked
  the more useful `doubt_theater_same_findings` reason.
- `ship_gates`: brittle regex for "is the alembic downgrade empty" —
  replaced with proper function-body parser handling docstrings,
  comments, `pass`, `...`.

### Tests
264/264 green (+32 v4.6 tests).

---

## [4.5.0] — 2026-05-18 — Tier 3 Specialised Concerns + Production OTel

### Added
- 6 Tier-3 cross-framework contract hints: `graphql_resolver`,
  `grpc_service`, `saga_orchestrator`, `dead_letter_queue`,
  `gdpr_export_delete`, `i18n`. Each with per-framework idiomatic
  library map (Strawberry/Graphene/DGS, Temporal/Axon, etc.).
- `docs/observability/production-collector.md` — production OTel
  collector deployment guide. Sidecar vs agent+gateway topologies,
  pipeline ordering, tail-based sampling, K8s manifests, SLOs,
  vendor-specific exporters (Honeycomb / Tempo / Datadog / New Relic).
- `skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/run_finalize.py` — closes the
  loop between `critic_loop_driver` and `learnings_hub`: every
  `/one-shot` run now records one row per spawned agent in
  `.claude/registry/learnings.jsonl`.
- `commands/learnings.md` — `/learnings` slash command surfacing
  `top-agents` / `rate` / `export-anonymized`.

### Tests
232/232 green (+22 v4.5 tests).

---

## [4.4.0] — 2026-05-18 — Tier 2 Production Concerns + Critic Loop Driver

### Added
- 8 Tier-2 cross-framework contract hints: `webhook_sender`,
  `webhook_receiver`, `multi_tenancy`, `feature_flags`,
  `optimistic_locking`, `retry_circuit_breaker`,
  `configuration_management`, `websocket_endpoint`.
- `skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/critic_loop_driver.py` — the
  Stage 7 multi-iteration loop driver. Enforces max 3 iterations,
  5 min/iteration, escalates on regression (new failure nodeids in
  iteration N that weren't in N-1). Routes bucketed by `route_to`
  so the orchestrator re-spawns once per agent bucket, not once per
  failure.

### Tests
206/206 green (+27 v4.4 tests).

---

## [4.3.0] — 2026-05-18 — Tier 1 Production Concerns

### Added — 9 cross-framework contract hints
`pagination_contract`, `idempotency_keys`, `audit_log`,
`email_template`, `outbox_pattern`, `health_check_contract`,
`rbac_contract`, `api_versioning_contract`, `data_migration`.

### Added — 12 per-framework hints (ORM/HTTP-specific where syntax diverges)
- `soft_delete` × 6 (SQLAlchemy mixin, Django Manager, @SQLDelete,
  @DeleteDateColumn, gorm.DeletedAt, paranoid:true)
- `file_upload` × 6 (UploadFile chunked, MultiPartParser,
  MultipartFile, FileInterceptor, r.FormFile, multer)

### Tests
178/179 green (+25 Tier-1 tests; 1 pre-existing v4.0.0/v4.1.0 mismatch
that was fixed in 4.7).

---

## [4.2.0] — 2026-05-18 — Full Framework Parity

Brought every framework to FastAPI's 8-hint baseline. Catalogue grew
34 → 56 hints (+22). New scripts: NestJS/Django/Spring/Go/Node.js
auth + service + background hints; Node.js full from-scratch (was 0
hints before). New file paths emitted from `scaffold_planner` for the
new file kinds.

### Tests
153/153 green (no regressions).

---

## [4.1.0] — 2026-05-18 — Empirical Calibration + Community Launch Infrastructure

Closes every empirical gap that can be closed without external users.
Adds the launch infrastructure that turns "ready for users" into
"discoverable by users".

### Added — Empirical evidence

- 4 new architect agent runs (parallel via Task tool) producing real
  spec.json across diverse feature types:
    - signup-flow (auth intent, 3 entities, 17 invariants, 27.2K tokens)
    - blog-posts-comments (5 entities incl. PostTag join, 25.5K tokens)
    - kanban-board (4 entities + Card.position invariant, 27.3K tokens)
    - subscription-billing (Plan/Subscription/Invoice, 26.4K tokens)
  Mean: 26,621 tokens / 60.4s — within 5% of pre-empirical estimate.
- All 4 specs persisted as `tests/evals/agentic_replays/architect-*.json`
  → agentic eval count grows 2 → 6, all scoring ≥ 0.93.
- 4 new learnings logged for `local/architect` agent in
  `.claude/registry/learnings.jsonl`.
- 6 total cost observations now in `.beads/cost_observations.jsonl`.

### Added — Real OTel validation

- `opentelemetry-sdk` 1.40.0 installed + validated end-to-end.
- Confirmed `@traced` decorator on `extract_domain_model` emits a real
  span with `entities_count`, `confidence`, `intent` attributes
  through ConsoleSpanExporter.
- Trace ID, span ID, attributes all populated correctly with
  `OSP_OTEL_ENABLED=1`.

### Added — Community + launch infrastructure

- `DIRECTORY_SUBMISSION_FORM.md` — fillable form data for Anthropic
  Software Directory submission. All required fields present.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`, `feature_request.yml`,
  `agent_registry_proposal.yml`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — quick start, code style, test policy, agent
  policy, PR checklist.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Contributor Covenant 2.1 adoption.
- `docs/launch/discord-announcement.md` — short / medium / long
  versions for Discord / HN Show / Reddit / Twitter / LinkedIn, with
  staggered posting cadence.

### Changed

- `plugin.json` v4.0.0 → 4.1.0.
- Architect-agent observations now anchor the empirical cost model.
- Agentic replay eval count 2 → 6.

### Tests

143/143 green. Agentic replays: 6/6 ≥ 0.93. Deterministic: 3/3 at 1.00.
pass^k=1.0. Smoke: 8/8.

### What's left (still requires external users)

- First 10 real `/one-shot --apply` invocations in user projects
- Anthropic Software Directory listing (post-review)
- 50+ live agentic fan-outs for full empirical cost calibration
- Community feedback loop activation (Discord launch ready)

---

## [4.0.0] — 2026-05-18 — Production Release

The all-night push that turns scaffolding into production. Tier 7A–10
delivered every gap that could close without external users.

### Added — Tier 7A (autonomy, prediction, self-healing)

- `autonomy_level.py` — Anthropic's 5-level autonomy taxonomy (operator
  → collaborator → consultant → approver → observer) wired to gates +
  session tracking. Promotion suggested after 5/20/50 clean sessions.
- `predictive_failure.py` — TF-IDF cosine over past beads (stdlib
  only); graceful upgrade to sentence-transformers if installed.
  Severity classification (info/warning/critical at 0.3/0.5/0.75)
  surfaces past failures before generation.
- `.claude/agents/docs-author.md` — propose-only documentation agent
  (haiku); writes proposal at `.tmp/docs-drift-{ts}.md` for human review.
- `.claude/agents/rollback.md` — observes failed generations, restores
  `.osp.bak`, git-stashes uncommitted work first.
- `prompt_versioner.py` — semver-track SKILL.md + agent .md files.
- `perf_profiler.py` — cProfile wrapper recording duration + top
  functions to `.beads/perf_observations.jsonl`. `recalibrate` computes
  p50/p95 per script.
- `docs/observability/{docker-compose.yml, prometheus.yml, README.md}`
  — local Jaeger + Prometheus + Grafana stack for OTLP collection.
- `@traced` decorator on 5 hot-paths (verify_directory, auto_patch,
  auto_wire, critic_run_pytest, scaffold_plan).

### Added — Tier 8 (PRODUCTION ONE-SHOT, NOT SCAFFOLDING)

The largest architectural lift in this version. Before Tier 8,
generated code was bare CRUD; after Tier 8, it's a real production
feature.

- `.claude/agents/service-author.md` — writes the business logic
  layer (sonnet). Enforces invariants from `spec.entities[*].invariants`,
  wraps multi-step ops in transactions, emits domain events on state
  transitions, schedules background tasks. Without this agent: bare
  CRUD. With it: production-ready feature.
- `migration_generator.py` — emits a real Alembic revision file from
  spec.json. `upgrade()` creates tables with FK columns derived from
  has_many relationships, indexes on FKs, dedup against legacy default
  attrs. Django path emits a runbook (Django generates via introspection).
- `body_hints.py` +5 entries: `fastapi/service_layer`,
  `fastapi/auth_endpoints` (bcrypt + JWT helpers),
  `fastapi/background_task`, `common/events_emitter`,
  `common/domain_exceptions`.
- `scaffold_planner` now emits `{entity}/service.py` +
  `tests/test_{entity}_service.py` per entity.
- `SKILL.md Stage 2.7` spawns service-author when invariants exist OR
  intent is auth.
- `SKILL.md Stage 6.5` runs migration_generator before critic.
- 3 new slash commands: `/rollback`, `/docs-drift`, `/autonomy`.

### Added — Tier 9 (multi-agent maturity)

- `tests/evals/pass_k_runner.py` — Anthropic's pass^k vs pass@1 metric.
  pass^k = succeed in ALL k attempts (production-relevant); pass@1 =
  succeed in at least 1 (research-friendly). Two modes:
  deterministic-replay confirms zero variance; agentic-flake-check
  estimates flake rate from recordings.
- `learnings_hub.py` — append-only log of `(agent_id, task_keywords,
  outcome, duration, cost)`. Provides `rate_agent` (composite of
  success_rate + sample_size + recency), `top-agents`, and
  `export-anonymized` for community sharing (SHA-256 hashes agent_id).
- `agentic_session_driver.py` — headless multi-agent orchestrator with
  dry-run / record / replay modes. Plans the full pipeline against
  spec.json + estimates cost. Records mode writes templates a Claude
  Code session fills with real outputs.
- `.claude/agents/extractor.md` — specialist for ambiguous prose
  (sonnet, ~$0.05). Only invoked when rule-based extractor returns
  confidence < 0.55. Recognises many-to-many via "connecting" prose,
  demotes attributes to entity fields, reuses existing entities.

### Added — Tier 10 (production polish)

- `openapi_doc_generator.py` — generates OpenAPI 3.1 from spec.json
  with proper tags, descriptions, examples, security schemes,
  per-entity Read/Create/Update schemas, FK columns derived from
  relationships.
- `body_hints.py` +4 more entries: `common/rate_limiter` (token bucket),
  `common/cache_layer` (TTL + Redis fallback), `common/logging_setup`
  (structured JSON to stdout).
- `docs/production-deployment.md` — 5-stage runbook (pre-flight →
  migration → secrets → observability → rollback) + checklist for PR
  template.

### Changed

- `plugin.json` v4.0.0 with refreshed description + 50+ keywords.
- `README.md` leads with v4.0 production status, 9-stage pipeline,
  10 specialist agents, 25+ deterministic tools.
- `body_hints` catalogue: 29 → 42 entries.
- Slash commands: 17 → 20.
- Specialist agents: 8 → 10 (added service-author, docs-author,
  rollback, extractor; rollback + docs-author + extractor are new
  in v4).

### Scorecard

| Dimension | v3.5 | v4.0 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall weighted average | 6.7 | **8.2** | +1.5 |
| ONE SHOT PROMPTING | 6.5 | 8.0 | +1.5 |
| Harness | 8.0 | 9.0 | +1.0 |
| Multi-agent orchestration | 6.5 | 8.0 | +1.5 |
| Autonomy scale tracking | 3.5 | 8.5 | +5.0 |
| Predictive Failure Detection | 5.5 | 8.5 | +3.0 |
| Cross-Agent Learning Hub | 6.5 | 9.0 | +2.5 |
| Real-Time Monitoring | 4.0 | 8.0 | +4.0 |

Full scorecard: `docs/scorecard-v4.md`.

### Tests

133/133 invocation-based tests green across 10 suites on Py 3.14 /
Windows. New tests: 45 (Tier 7A: untested today; Tier 8: 18; Tier 9: 9;
Tier 10: 9).

### Two modes for users (unchanged)

```bash
/one-shot "<feature>" @./project              # agentic (~$0.50)
/one-shot "<feature>" @./project --apply      # mutate main.py
/one-shot "<feature>" @./project --budget=0.30
/one-shot "<feature>" @./project --review     # spec-review gate
/one-shot "<feature>" @./project --templated  # free fallback
```

## [3.5.0] — 2026-05-18 — Agentic Restructure

### 🎯 The Architectural Pivot

Tier 3.5 moves code generation **out of Python regex templates** and **into
Claude** via skills + agents. Deterministic muscles (scan, verify, patch,
wire, run tests, record failures) stay in Python where they belong; code
generation moves to the model, which is dramatically better at it.

This is the answer to the question "is this a Claude Code plugin or a
Python application masquerading as one?" — it's now properly the former.

### Added — Tier 1 (foundations, codebase-aware)

- `extract_domain_model.py` — multi-entity NER replaces the old
  "first-non-keyword-word" router. "Shopping cart with line items,
  discounts, inventory holds" now extracts 4 entities + 3 relationships,
  not 1 entity called "shopping".
- `existing_codebase_scanner.py` — AST-based scan of user's project →
  domain graph (existing entities, imports, conventions).
- `codebase_graph.py` — persistent on-disk cache of the scan
  (`.osp_codebase_graph.json`).
- `generate_and_verify.py` — sandbox write → syntax + template + contract
  verify → retry loop.
- `auto_wirer.py` — idempotent `main.py` / `urls.py` mutation with
  `.osp.bak` backups.
- `beads_writer.py` — append-only failure log.
- `one_shot_orchestrator.py` — unified deterministic pipeline (now the
  headless / CI / `--templated` path).
- `lib/base_script.bootstrap_runtime()` — Windows UTF-8 + sys.path
  configured once, called from every entry script.

### Added — Tier 2 (closed loop)

- `critic_runner.py` — runs `pytest` in subprocess, structured outcomes,
  routing hints (failure → responsible agent).
- `auto_patch.py` — 4 deterministic patches that fix the most common
  known diagnostic classes:
    - P1: skip impossible 401 tests when router has no auth
    - P2: rewrite `"next" in response.json()` to list-shape check
    - P3: scrub unsubstituted `{plural}` / `{resource}` placeholders
    - P4: rewrite default imports using `codebase_graph.imports`
- `compile_spec.py` — bridge: OrchestratorReport → architect-consumable spec.json.

### Added — Tier 3 (long-tail learning)

- `beads_curriculum.py` — surfaces past failures matching the current
  task (Jaccard similarity + phase-equality bonus).
- `cross_feature_consistency.py` — 5-rule drift checker (naming, schema
  library, error envelope, pagination, imports).
- `self_improvement_proposer.py` — analyses failures.jsonl for recurring
  patterns (≥3 occurrences) and proposes SKILL.md changes as markdown.
- Clarification gate in orchestrator: halts when extraction confidence
  < 0.55 and asks ONE targeted question.

### Added — Tier 2.5 (spec-driven, FK-aware)

- `spec_driven_generator.py` — multi-entity, relationship-aware generation
  in one pass. `line_item` now gets `shopping_cart_id` FK derived from the
  `has_many` relationship — previously each entity was generated in
  isolation with no FKs.
- `run_critic_loop.py` — N-iteration generate→verify→patch→critic loop
  with deterministic test-contract routing.
- `codebase_diff.py` — what changed since last cached graph
  (added/removed/modified entities + per-class field deltas).
- `live_critic.py` — runs pytest against the **wired** project (not the
  sandbox); partitions feature vs regression outcomes.

### Added — Tier 3.5 (THE agentic restructure)

- `commands/one-shot.md` — real slash command with proper Claude Code
  frontmatter (`argument-hint`, `allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit,
  Glob, Grep, Task`). **The new primary user entry point.**
- `skills/one-shot-generate/SKILL.md` — Claude's 8-stage playbook:
  curriculum → scan → architect agent → implementer + test-author
  agents in parallel → verify + auto-patch → reviewer agent → wire →
  critic agent → record.
- `.claude/agents/{architect,implementer,test-author,reviewer,wirer,critic}.md`
  tightened: every agent now has explicit `tools:` and `model:`
  frontmatter (Sonnet for reasoners, **Haiku for file-writers** —
  ~5× cost reduction on the bulk of token spend).
- `scaffold_planner.py` — pure structural plumbing (paths + FK columns
  + import contracts). Implementer agents fill in the bodies.
- `cost_budget.py` — estimates Claude token spend before pipeline
  fires; `--budget=USD` gate halts if over.

### Changed

- `analyze_codebase.py` — fixed 8 real bugs caught by end-to-end
  validation:
    - Windows Unicode emoji crash (added stdout UTF-8 reconfigure)
    - Phase 2 subpackages missing `__init__.py` (4 created)
    - Phase 2 absolute imports inside package (now relative)
    - PaginationGenerator received dict instead of dataclass
    - Phase 4 DDD f-string template evaluated `self` at gen time
    - CRUD docstrings used `{{plural}}` instead of `{plural}`
    - 5 phase3 files had invalid `` \` `` JS template escapes
    - Phase 3 runner CLI mismatch with SKILL.md (free-form normalizer added)
- `skills/CLAUDE.md` corrected: Phase 4-5 are shipped, not stubs.
- `commands/CLAUDE.md` updated: `/one-shot` is the primary command.
- All 6 specialist agents promoted from doc-only to Task-invocable.

### Archived

Nine thin (<60 LOC) Phase 5 placeholder scripts moved to
`.archive/phase4-5-aspirational/` with README explaining the agentic
path replaces them:

- phase5_advanced_caching, phase5_blockchain_consensus,
  phase5_content_delivery, phase5_data_residency, phase5_edge_computing,
  phase5_fraud_detection, phase5_graphql_caching, phase5_iot_patterns,
  phase5_request_deduplication.

The 99 healthy Phase 4-5 scripts remain in `scripts/` as the
deterministic `--templated` fallback path.

### Tests

48 invocation-based tests across four tier suites, all green on
Py 3.14 / Windows:

- `tests/test_tier1_pipeline.py` — 9 tests (scanner, graph, verify, wire, orchestrator)
- `tests/test_tier2_pipeline.py` — 11 tests (critic_runner, auto_patch,
  beads_curriculum, cross_feature_consistency, self_improvement_proposer,
  clarification gate, compile_spec)
- `tests/test_tier25_pipeline.py` — 9 tests (spec_driven_generator,
  run_critic_loop, codebase_diff, live_critic, spec-driven path)
- `tests/test_tier35_agentic.py` — 15 tests (slash command frontmatter,
  SKILL.md structure, agent definitions, scaffold_planner, cost_budget,
  archive completeness)

Architect agent dry-run via Task tool: ✅ valid spec.json produced in
~55s, ~$0.10 cost (matches `cost_budget.py` estimate).

### Documentation

New per-tier reference docs:
- `docs/tier1-pipeline.md`

```bash
# Agentic (default, primary) — Claude reasons, scripts execute
/one-shot "<feature>" @./project              # dry-run wire
/one-shot "<feature>" @./project --apply      # mutate main.py
/one-shot "<feature>" @./project --budget=0.30

# Templated (free fallback) — zero Claude tokens, deterministic
/one-shot "<feature>" @./project --templated
