Render the initial tour state. The user picks an option, you call back into this script with their choice.

```!
python "./skills/one-shot-generator/scripts/interactive_tour.py" --json
```

Show the prompt + numbered options to the user. When they reply, transition to the next state by re-running the script with the chosen key. Stop when a `recommendation` state arrives -- that state contains the template id + ready-to-paste prompt.
